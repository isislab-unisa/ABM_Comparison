# ABM_Comparison
Code used for the performance comparison for the article "Experimenting with Agent-based Model Simulation Tools"

# ABMSurvey

In this repository, we tested some ABM frameworks available:

    ActressMas
    Agent.jl
    AgentPy
    CppyABM
    Gama
    krABMaga
    MASON
    MESA
    NetLogo
    Repast

for each model not provided by the framework, we tried our best to develop a coherent model. 
In the following table, :white_check_mark: means the model is already available, :x: otherwise.

In each directory, you can find tests and eventually scripts to run the benchmarks. Pay attention, you have to correctly install frameworks in order to run the benchmarks. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions about scripts and/or tests or if you can't reproduce our results.

## actressmass

- visual studio -> clone repository -> insert url 'https://github.com/florinleon/ActressMas.git'
- open and build it through visual studio

## Agents.jl

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add("Agents")
```
```console 
julia namefile.jl
```

## AgentPy

```python
pip install agentpy
```

- change parameters in the file for desired configuration
- run with 
    ```python
        python3 flock.py > 1000.txt
    ```
- the basic script provided clean the results of the runs, from 1000 to 128000
- since the automatic batch running provided by the framework sums up all the results, you can repeat the last lines on the .py file to reach the desired repetitions, or write a more elegant loop

## CppyABM
- These are the lines to build the cppy framework provided by the docs. If you have troubles while executing the 'make install' command, ignore it
    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/janursa/CppyABM && cd CppyABM && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. -DCPP=TRUE && make install
    ```
- Copy the flockers folders from this repo into the CppyABM folder
```console
cd flockers && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && ./appABM
```
- change the parameters in the models.h file for desired configuration
- change the number of repetitions in batch_run.cpp file
- if you want to write a new model, you may missing a dependencies considered fundamental by the library. 
add this line at the start of models.h file
```c++
#include <chrono>
``` 

## Gama

- download executable from site https://gama-platform.org/
- copy the file of gama from this folder to the workspace of GAMA
- use the custom tool of the ide

## krABMaga

- clone the https://github.com/krABMaga/examples repository and follow the instructions provided in each subfolder to build the desired example

## Mason

- install mason with the instruction provided https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/
- import the file provided by this repo and use the script, carefully checking the position of the jar generated by mason

## Mesa

```python
pip install mesa
```
```console 
python namefile.py
```

## Netlogo

- install netlogo https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml
- use the script provided in this repo to build and run the examples 

## Repast

-- install repast https://repast.github.io/repast_simphony.html
-- create a new Repast project with their tools
-- import the files provided in this repo
-- fine tuning the parameters and properties of the project, based on your os and paths of various dependencies
